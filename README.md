# Indoor Navigation Simulator

This is a simulation for the 2023 Lemelson-MIT Inventeam competition!

My team prototyped an autonomously indoor-navigating walker which could be summoned from other rooms by the elderly using a wearable. This simulation is a proof of concept of the indoor navigation algorithm I designed.
